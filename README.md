# DiSE
A diffusion probabilistic model for automatic structure elucidation of organic compounds. DiSE follows a two-stage workflow—edge-noise injection and subsequent denoising—and employs a tailored graph representation that fully leverages all available spectra, including MS, 1H and 13C chemcial shifts, HSQC and COSY.
